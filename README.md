# ArduinoStrike
ArduinoStrike is a program designed to control the recoil of weapons in **Counter-Strike 2** using **Arduino Leonardo** or any other compatible board. This tool simulates mouse movements for recoil control, implements rapid fire for semi-automatic weapons and adds bunny hop functionality. The software does not interact with the game client in any way, which makes it difficult to be detected by anti-cheat.

### Key Features
| Feature                   | Description                                                                                      |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Recoil Control**        | Reduces gun recoil by simulating controlled downward mouse movements for more accurate shots. |
| **Rapid Fire**            | Enhances the firing rate of semi-automatic weapons for faster shooting.                          |
| **Bunny Hop (Bhop)**      | Automatically performing jumps while holding down the spacebar provides quick movement in the game.     |
| **ColorBot (Color TriggerBot)** | Detects the color change on the screen when aiming with a rifle and fires the fastest possible shot without delay.        |
| **FastReload**            | Speeds up the reloading process of certain weapons in certain scenarios, allowing you to continue firing faster. |

### Additional Details
- **Note:** To enable the bhop feature, enter the command `bind mwheeldown +jump` in the game console.  
- **Important:** ArduinoStrike **does not require a USB Host Shield**â€”it connects to the PC via USB and functions as an HID device.

# Getting Started
### Requirements
- **Hardware**: Arduino Leonardo (or compatible board with native USB HID support)
- **Software**: Arduino IDE, Counter-Strike 2

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DeniedAccessLife/ArduinoStrike.git
cd ArduinoStrike
```

2. **Open the Project in Arduino IDE**  
Open the `ArduinoStrike.ino` file located in the `ArduinoSketch` folder in the repository.

3. **Connect and Configure Arduino**  
Connect Arduino board to your computer. In the Arduino IDE, select the appropriate **Board** (`Arduino Leonardo`) and **Port**.

4. **Upload the Firmware**  
Click the **Upload** button in the Arduino IDE to flash the `ArduinoStrike` firmware to your board. Once uploaded, your Arduino will function as an HID device, controlling mouse movements according to the code logic.

# Configuration
If the `Settings.cfg` file is not found when launching the program, you will be prompted to enter the following settings into the console:

| Setting               | Description                                                      | Value Type                 | Range/Options                    |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Bhop**              | Enables or disables the bunny hop functionality.                 | Integer                    | `1` (enable) / `0` (disable)     |
| **Rapid Fire**        | Enables or disables rapid fire.                                  | Integer                    | `1` (enable) / `0` (disable)     |
| **Sensitivity**       | Sets game sensitivity level.                                     | Integer                    | `1` to `8`                       |
| **Zoom Sensitivity**  | Adjusts sensitivity when zoomed in.                              | Decimal                    | `0.01` to `3.00`                 |
| **Confirmation Key**  | Assigns a virtual key code for confirmation or disables it.      | Integer                    | VK_CODE (enable) / `0` (disable) |
| **ColorBot Activation Key** | Sets a virtual key code to activate ColorBot or disables it. | Integer                  | VK_CODE (enable) / `0` (disable) |
| **ColorBot Threshold** | Sets the allowed color deviation threshold for ColorBot.       | Integer                     | `0` to `20`                      |
| **FastReload**        | Enables or disables fast reloading.                             | Integer                     | `1` (enable) / `0` (disable)     |

### Additional Details
- **ColorBot Threshold**: Higher values increase tolerance for color variations.
- **Sensitivity and Zoom Sensitivity**: Adjust these to match your gameplay preferences.
- **Virtual Key Codes (VK_CODE):** You can find VK_CODE values [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes) if you want to assign specific keys for activation.

These settings will be saved to `Settings.cfg` for future launches. You can edit this file to update the configuration as needed.
